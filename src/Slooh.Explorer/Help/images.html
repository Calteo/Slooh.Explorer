    <p>
        In the green fields below the captions you can enter a filter expression, so the list gets reduced to the matching items.
        <ul>
            <li>Entering some text will find all missions containing that text (i.e. "M105" will match the title "Elliptical Galaxy M105").</li>
            <li>Entering "*" will match any characters and "?" will only match a single character.</li>
            <li>On the text columns there can be an operator at the beginning of the filter expression. Possible are "=", "<=", ">=", ">", "<" and operate like they normally do.</li>
            <li>On the Date column there are only ">=", "<=", "<" and ">". Entering just a date will match all missions on that date.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
